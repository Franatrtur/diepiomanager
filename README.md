## Diep.io setup manager
A script that automatically manages upgrade presets for the game [diep.io](diep.io).  
It can remember all your favourite setups and set up your upgrades before the game.  
You can simply run it and not get distracted by having to think about spending upg points.
### Usage
__Main dependency:__ pyautogui `pip install pyautogui`.  
Simply download the files from the repository and run index.py. done!  
Type `help` to see all the available commands.  
Open diep.io, join a game and use the `run` command in the script to run a preset.  
Presets can be created with the `create` command, the resulting setup code can be saved with the `save` command or you can share it with other players.

### Capabilities
The script is very basic and is not hardwired to diep.io in any way.  
While the enviroment for creating presets allows rammer mode and god mode, this isnt actually applicable since the game doesnt support overflowing points for tank change.
